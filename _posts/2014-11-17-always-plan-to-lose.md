title: Always Plan to Lose

> Whenever you have to plan something, don't plan to succeed. Instead plan so that you will fail. Then you will definitely succeed.

Today was probably one of the most miserable days in my life. There was an event that we had planned at work which required the use of my speakers. I was especially excited about this event that we had been planning since over a month as the defining feature would be the sub-woofer powered speakers that I had.

_Of course, where is the fun if things go the way you want it to?_

The day got off to a terrible start with me having to struggle to get the speaker out of the loft where it was stored. There were other useless stuff dumped on top of the speakers thereby snagging the wires and caused me much trouble to get it down. Ended up taking a lot of trouble balancing 5-6 heavy objects in my hands and finally getting the heavy speakers down and brought it to my room to test, only to discover that an audio input plug had broken and was lodged within the socket, thereby rendering it useless.

Was followed was extreme disappointment and frustration even after struggling to free the broken plug for over 45 mins, followed by throwing the speaker set straight into the dustbin, foregoing my breakfast, tripling my blood pressure, and generally draining each and every bit of energy from my body.

Needless to say, the event didn't turn out as great as I had imagined it, thereby bring and end to the disastrous day.

So what is the takeaway? All that we had planned was how to do things right to reach the goal that we wanted. We failed to think about what would go wrong. We assumed that everything will work out the way we had planned.

In fact a few weeks back I mentioned this
> the best plan ever is to not make a plan at all

I have always hated to delegate things, or in other words leave control, since things would never be done the way I wanted to done. And I hate micro-managing people as I feel people have the maturity to do things right. So it frustrates me all the more when someone puts paid to my fears.

Anyway, getting back to my quote, of course I like to go with the flow and not over-engineer too much. And while I was think about these two aspects; _to not make a plan_ vs _detailed planning that fails_, it struck me as to where I have been going totally wrong.

When things go right, you don't need to plan at all for it. It will of course go in the right direction and you just have to grab the opportunity and go with the flow. 

But, when things take a turn for the worse, that is when you need to work things out. A key part of project execution is definitely monitoring. You need to monitor the progress of a plan / project in order to know whether things are going on track, or off track. Only with this knowledge can you decide whether you let things be, or have to step in to fix things.

But what will you do when things go wrong? That is where the plan to fail helps you out. When you make a plan for any project, think about the 100 different things that can go wrong and end up completely sidelining your plan. When you come up with all these things that can go wrong, then you can plan fallbacks. Then you think about what all can go wrong with the fallback plan. Think about each aspect, each false piece, each stumbling block, and make a plan for what you will do to bring the project back on track when you encounter any of these problems.

In essence this is what _Project Management_ calls risks and risk mitigation. I would like to call this the **plan itself** and would like to focus more on this part than the actual plan itself. As I said before, you spend 5% effort when the plan goes on track, but you have to spend 200% effort when things go wrong, compounded with 100% loss of motivation.

So, when you make any project plan, try to plan how the project will fail. Outthink the risks, and you can then watch your project flow smoothly to success.
