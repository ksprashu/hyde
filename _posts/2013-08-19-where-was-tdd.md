title: Where was TDD?
---

Let me start by saying that I am an evangelist for ‘_Test Driven Development_‘. I believe that it works, and even for my hobby projects at home, I use this methodology.

TDD is good as it helps focus on the smaller functionalities and the smaller aspects of the application. TDD ensures that everything is tested so that it can be changed later without fear. TDD ensures that you spend some time to think about the smallest detail and test that it works.

Test whether what you are writing works, eh? Hmmmm…

I remember the day(or days, was it?) some 15 years ago, when I was in the 11th grade and I was learning C++. I never had a PC of my own and the only time in front of one would be in the computer lab in school which I would access for maybe 2 hours in a week. I used to write large programs on many sheets of paper, and when I got the chance to step into the computer lab, I would finish my regular course work ASAP and get on with keying in my program as fast as my fingers would let me.

Even many years before that; in the 10th grade, when I had to turn in my year-end projects, I would write dozens of pages of BASIC code and then just key it in when I had the chance. 

Oh what the heck, I’ve even written a ‘screensaver’ of fishes swimming in an aquarium, in LOGO, in maybe 6th or 7th grade.

The common factor in all these? _The code would just work!_

Even though it was all conceptualized on a piece(s) of paper, barring very few typos and corrections, the programs would all work. Test Driven Development? I should think not. Far from it in fact.

And that brings me to this whole point about TDD again. Yes, it is great. Yes, it works. But wasn’t our code more robust and beautiful before? Did we lose our route on the way to becoming a higher paid programmer? Where did we lose our professionalism, due to which we only focus on churning out code without any emphasis on testing and quality.

As Uncle Bob says, **“Someone who delivers code that is not tested, is not a professional”**.

Who can now lay a finger on what changed with the world; from the days of the punched cards and where computing power was extremely expensive, to the current days with new compilers and programming language popping up dime a dozen, and software engineering practices being formulated just to make someone a professional?
