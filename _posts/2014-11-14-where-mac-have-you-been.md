title: Where Mac have you been?
---

**I have always been a Mac hater.** 

Well, not always. I used to be among the first ones in my friends group in school to have ever heard of a Macintosh. Those were the times when HCL was probably the only household computer name around in India and they had come out with something called the _HCL BeanStalk_. Apple had then run half a page ads of the Macintosh with a well-sized astronaut in the background.

I have no idea what the astronaut meant to the ad, but I was hooked on the device. I have never used a Mac, I probably never knew the history of the Mac, but something in me wanted the Mac. I used to campaign about it all over my class. Many might have even believed that I owned one.

Come to think about it, it looked plain jane and the GUI if I look at it today is way too ugly. I still think Windows 3.1 or maybe Windows 95 was much prettier. Hell, _even MS-DOS was nicer to look at_, just kidding of course. ;-)

But of course I could never afford a PC back then, let alone a Mac.

The second love happened when the **iMac** was released. Oh hell, that was a lovely sight to behold. What with its clean lines and translucent hues and all. That was an object of desire. Of course, I never knew much about the OS and what it could do.

And yes, I never got me one of that either!

It all boiled down to the cost and even after my affordability increased, I used to keep asking the question (of any Apple product) on why it was so overpriced. I could very well get the same specced device at half the price. Of course it wasn’t a Mac, but hey, what did I know?

It’s been around 20 years since and I have not had the chance to use a Mac let alone gaze intently upon one until very recently when I opted to pick up a Macbook Pro as my developer machine at work.

Oh how things took a 180 degree turn.

Be it as it may that I was hard to get adjusted to the Mac after 15 years of hacking away on Windows. The Linux chops definitely helped and I was able to get instantly familiar with the shell which helped a lot and is one of the most powerful features on the Mac. I still don’t deny the fact that it is overpriced for a normal human being.

To me, _the Mac is like the perfect blend of the usability and stability of Windows and the command-line-hackability and programmer-friendliness of Linux._ 

So, that brings be to the point of this post. 

I am a self-confessed geek and I love programming and learning new languages and libraries and stuff. That is one of the primary reasons that I couldn’t break away from Linux though I was frustrated by the sheer high maintenance it involved to use and maintain. However, I learnt many languages and was aware of many technologies as just another thing to do.

Now when I am using the Mac and learning more about how things are done on the Mac, I seem to be having  DejaVu moment. The whole philosophy of programming is coming back to me. I can imagine myself in the place where how a language and its libraries were being formed. A lot of what I have learnt as disconnected entities are just fitting in together seamlessly.

It’s hard to explain, but the way the OS X is built and the emphasis on various libraries and languages as a core part of the OS itself, helps one form a way of thinking about programming that integrates with the OS experience itself.

While brushing up some bits on Ruby, I can reflect on how I struggled with Ruby and Python on Windows. Python was so much more easier to work with on Linux, and Ruby just about fits to Mac like a glove. Ruby again is no slouch. You just see how the language has helped shape the many Libraries and technologies out there. You can just about see the origins and the formation of TDD and so many testing libraries in the depths of Ruby. Gems is a weird by immensely popular concept that in the end just works, and you can just get so much done with it. Rails, what to say about it, it has set the stage for the startups of the world to emerge and scale out quickly without much fuss. 

And while you learn about and appreciate all this and how it all started, you can just picture a Mac sitting by the corner with a satisfied smirk.

When I think about it, this is something that I have missed during my formative years. Maybe I would have been a better programmer and might have taken to some really different set of mainstream languages, had I embraced the use of a Mac early on. There are many styles of programming that would have just made sense instead of me having to force learning them.

Like I said, this is hard to explain, but what I would like to recommend to aspiring programming and young developers, especially those who want to get into the open source world and even more important, those who would like to get the grips on Ruby, Rails and related frameworks, to get started off on a Mac. You should be able to pick up some cheap options on eBay and this would seriously help you out in the long run.

Now, I too am a believer!

**I program…therefore I am… a Mac! :-P**


_PS: Some of you might be up in arms about Linux being the creator and not Mac. That would definitely be true, but where I see it is that a Mac helps hide the clutter and compatibility-hell of Linux and lets you enjoy clean Unix goodness_
